Ingredients:

1 large cup/2 normal cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup warm water
1 tsp dry yeast
0.75 tsp salt
1/2 tsp sugar
1 tbsp olive oil

Optional: garlic powder

How to make:

1. Add yeast, sugar and salt to some warm water and mix until there are no blobs of yeast left. Leave it to sit for 5 minutes.
2. In a large bowl, put your flour and optionally, garlic powder. Stir it slowly with a metal spoon pour in your yeast juice.
3. Put your spoon down. Now take your hands and do that thing you see in movies when they are making bread.
If the dough is too sticky, add some flour. If it's too hard, add some more warm water.
4. When it gets to soft play dough consistency, rub some olive oil in.
5. Place your pizza dough in a large bowl or pot, cover with a cloth and place someplace warm. Leave it to rise for about an hour.
6. Once the dough has risen, shape your pizza base using something cylindrical. 
7. Add your toppings and bake in 220C oven for around 15 minutes (could be less or more, depending on how thick or thin your base is).

Enjoy!
